# TODOs

* Review features + ergonomics of balance language
* Port style back to other ariths / imp if needed
  * Do we need the first version? Just use the final one?
  * Maybe strip back to "no functions" and implement?
    * This could be a good example
* Set up CI for small defs
* Write Pyk prover
* Port proofs from SPLS
  * Transfer - total balance
  * Write sum-N
